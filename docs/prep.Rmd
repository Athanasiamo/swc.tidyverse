## Recommended setup
This workshop is a combination of presentation, live coding and exercises. 
If you are attending it as a webinar, having a dual monitor set-up is recommended. 
This would enable you to follow the live coding, by also typing in the commands and experience the effects you self.
Programming is a skill where you learn best by doing.

That being said, as there are also exercises, so you can also follow using a single monitor. 

## Install R
Make sure to have R installed on your computer.
It is recommended that you have a newer version of R installed, and it must be newer than version **4.0.0**.
Download R from [the R-project](https://www.r-project.org/)
If you attend the course with an older R version than this, you cannot expect the results of your code to be the same as the other participants and the instructors.

#### Windows computers
The tidyverse packages require [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to be installed. 
Make sure to have the required version installed before proceeding.

## Install RStudio

The best experience with the workshop is to have an RStudio newer than 1.3. 
It is not necessary, but highly recommended.

## Install course materials

Open your RStudio and paste the following code into the pane called "Console":

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins"), Ncpus = 2)
```

If you are still struggling to install the package, please create [a ticket](https://github.com/Athanasiamo/swc.tidyverse/issues) pasting the command and output you get so I can help you get it sorted.
We will also be hosting a 1 hour guided install session from **11-12am** on **Friday 21at of May**. Please join this session for more "hands-on" direct help in getting you up to speed.

### If you are on a MacBook with the M1 chip.
The M1-processor for new MacBooks, it all its glory, does not run RStudio. We cannot control this. If you have a MacBook with the M1-chip let us know via e-mail, and we will create a learning environment for you in RStudio cloud.
