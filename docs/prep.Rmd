## Recommended setup
This workshop is a combination of presentation, live coding and exercises. 
If you are attending it as a webinar, having a dual monitor set-up is recommended. 
This would enable you to follow the live coding, by also typing in the commands and experience the effects you self.
Programming is a skill where you learn best by doing.

That being said, as there are also exercises, so you can also follow using a single monitor. 

## Install R
Make sure to have R installed on your computer.
It is recommended that you have a newer version of R installed, and it must be newer than version **4.0.0**.
Download R from [the R-project](https://www.r-project.org/)
If you attend the course with an older R version than this, you cannot expect the results of your code to be the same as the other participants and the instructors.

#### Windows computers
The tidyverse packages require [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to be installed. 
Make sure to have the required version installed before proceeding.

## Install RStudio

The best experience with the workshop is to have an RStudio newer than 1.3. 
It is not necessary, but highly recommended.

[RStudio downloads page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


## Install course materials

Open your RStudio and paste the following code into the pane called "Console":

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

If you are still struggling to install the package, please create [a ticket](https://github.com/Athanasiamo/swc.tidyverse/issues) pasting the command and output you get so I can help you get it sorted.
We will also be hosting a 1 hour guided install session from **11-12am** on **Friday 21at of May**. Please join this session for more "hands-on" direct help in getting you up to speed.


## Test loading the package

Try loading the tidyverse package by running the below code in your console.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This is the expected output after running this command
```r
-- Attaching packages ---------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --
v ggplot2 3.3.3     v purrr   0.3.4
v tibble  3.1.1     v dplyr   1.0.5
v tidyr   1.1.3     v stringr 1.4.0
v readr   1.4.0     v forcats 0.5.1
-- Conflicts ------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```


If you see a warning after this command, that looks like the below, that is ok. 
If you get something saying `Error` please let us know, but **warnings** at this stage can be ignored.

```r
