      "contents": "\nRecommended setup\nThis workshop is a combination of presentation, live coding and exercises. If you are attending it as a webinar, having a dual monitor set-up is recommended. This would enable you to follow the live coding, by also typing in the commands and experience the effects you self. Programming is a skill where you learn best by doing.\nThat being said, as there are also exercises, so you can also follow using a single monitor.\nInstall R\nMake sure to have R installed on your computer. It is recommended that you have a newer version of R installed, and it must be newer than version 4.0.0. Download R from the R-project If you attend the course with an older R version than this, you cannot expect the results of your code to be the same as the other participants and the instructors.\nWindows computers\nThe tidyverse packages require rtools to be installed. Make sure to have the required version installed before proceeding.\nInstall RStudio\nThe best experience with the workshop is to have an RStudio newer than 1.3. It is not necessary, but highly recommended.\nRStudio downloads page\nInstall course materials\nOpen your RStudio and paste the following code into the pane called “Console”:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nIf you are still struggling to install the package, please create a ticket pasting the command and output you get so I can help you get it sorted. We will also be hosting a 1 hour guided install session from 11-12am on Friday 21at of May. Please join this session for more “hands-on” direct help in getting you up to speed.\nTest loading the package\nTry loading the tidyverse package by running the below code in your console.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nThis is the expected output after running this command\n-- Attaching packages ---------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --\nv ggplot2 3.3.3     v purrr   0.3.4\nv tibble  3.1.1     v dplyr   1.0.5\nv tidyr   1.1.3     v stringr 1.4.0\nv readr   1.4.0     v forcats 0.5.1\n-- Conflicts ------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nIf you see a warning after this command, that looks like the below, that is ok. If you get something saying Error please let us know, but warnings at this stage can be ignored.\nWarning messages:\n1: package ‘tidyverse’ was built under R version 4.0.5 \n2: package ‘tibble’ was built under R version 4.0.5 \n3: package ‘tidyr’ was built under R version 4.0.5 \n4: package ‘dplyr’ was built under R version 4.0.5 \n5: package ‘forcats’ was built under R version 4.0.5\n\n\n\n",
