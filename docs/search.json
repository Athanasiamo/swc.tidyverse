      "contents": "\nRecommended setup\nThis workshop is a combination of presentation, live coding and exercises. If you are attending it as a webinar, having a dual monitor set-up is recommended. This would enable you to follow the live coding, by also typing in the commands and experience the effects you self. Programming is a skill where you learn best by doing.\nThat being said, as there are also exercises you can also follow using a single monitor.\nInstall R\nMake sure to have R installed on your computer. It is recommended that you have a newer version of R installed, preferably higher than 4.0.0, but at minimum higher than 3.5.3. Download R from the R-project\nWindows computers\nThe tidyverse packages require rtools to be installed. Make sure to have the required version installed before proceeding.\nInstall RStudio\nThe best experience with the workshop is to have an RStudio newer than 1.3. It is not necessary, but highly recommended.\nRStudio downloads page\nInstall course materials\nThis package contains materials that are necessary for the workshop.\nYou can install tidyquintro from github, which will also install the packages that the tutorial will cover, with\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"Athanasiamo/tidyquintro\")\nLoading the package\nLoading the package will also load the necessary libraries directly\nlibrary(tidyquintro)\nAdditionally, there are exercises connected to each of the topics which will also be accessible via the learnr-package.\nlearnr::available_tutorials(\"tidyquintro\")\nIf install fails\nIf the above install fails, you can try installing everything individually and then the package from source. Start by installing the dependent packages for the course:\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"learnr\", \"remotes\"))\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio-education/gradethis\")\nWhen these are successful, you should be able to install the course package. Download the newest tar-version from the source directory, make sure you know where it has downloaded to and install with\n# Alter the /path/to section to the path where the downloaded file is. \ninstall.packages(\"/path/to/tidyquintro_0.1.01.tar.gz\", repos = NULL)\nIf you are still struggling to install the package, please create a ticket pasting the command and output you get so I can help you get it sorted.\n\n\n\n",
