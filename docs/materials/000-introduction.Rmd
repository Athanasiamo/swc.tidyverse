Welcome to our workshop on working with datasets in R and the Tidyverse.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you all that this is a software carpentry arrange course, meaning we operate under a code of conduct.
If you feel that someone is violating the CoC or is making you feel uncomfortable in any way, to contact one of the helpers or instructors in a direct message in the zoom chat so we may assist you.
We are dedicated to a harassment free learning environment, and want everyone to feel comfortable in this shared space. 

If you have questions at any point during the course, please ask the question in the chat to everyone. 
Please, make sure questions are in general asked to 'everyone', so that all may benefit from the answers.
If you are wondering about something, its likely more are also.
The helpers will answer certain questions in the chat directly, or interrupt the instructors for them to answer them.

For this course, we will be actively using break-out rooms during most exercises. 
You will be allocated a specific break-room and a helper for your room, and this will be the people you will work with throughout the course. 
We hope you get familiar and comfortable with each other in the break out rooms, and help each other learn.
Be patient with each other, some pick up coding faster than others. 

I'd like everyone to open their RStudio now. 
You should all have been given install instructions before today, and hopefully you are all set to go. 

For this course, I'm going to rearrange my RStudio panes a little. 
This is both my personal preference when I work, but mostly I'm doing it now because we have been given feedback that during online teaching this configuration is often easier to look at. 

**Show standard RStudio setup**
_explain the different panes_

**Show altering the setup so that Console is on top right, only history on bottom left, minimize history to the smallest possible**

> Ask about the size of things, can they see the text ok?


In a in-person course, usually we have everyone typing along as we instruct. 
For those of you that have two monitors (i.e. a laptop and extra screen, or computer with either one large screen or two screens) this should be possible, and the recommended way to learn during this course.
Typing code is the best way to start getting used to it and to start understanding what the results of the code are.

If you have just a single small screen (like your laptop), we realise that both having us on zoom _and_ having RStudio open to type along is going to be difficult.
There is an option in zoom that might make this better for you and that you can try out.
