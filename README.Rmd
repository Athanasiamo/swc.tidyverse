A 4 hour workshop with quick introduction to [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Workshop preparations

### Recommended setup
This workshop is a combination of presentation, live coding and exercises. 
If you are attending it as a webinar, having a dual monitor set-up is recommended. 
This would enable you to follow the live coding, by also typing in the commands and experience the effects you self.
Programming is a skill where you learn best by doing.

That being said, as there are also exercises you can also follow using a single monitor. 

### Install R
Make sure to have R installed on your computer.
Download R from [the R-project](https://www.r-project.org/)

### Install RStudio

The best experience with the workshop is to have an RStudio newer than 1.3. 
It is not necessary, but highly recommended.

[RStudio downloads page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Windows computers
The tidyverse packages require [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to be installed. 
Make sure to have the required version installed before proceeding.

### Install

This package contains materials that are necessary for the workshop. 

You can install tidyquintro from [github](https://github.com/Athanasiamo/tidyquintro), which will also install the packages that the tutorial will cover, with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes") # uncomment to install if you do not have this package
remotes::install_github("Athanasiamo/tidyquintro")
```

If the above install fails, you can try installing the package from source. 
Download the newest tar-version from the [source](source/) directory, and install with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("path/to/tidyquitro_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```


### Loading the package
Loading the package will also load the necessary libraries directly
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyquintro)
```

Additionally, there are exercises connected to each of the topics which will also be accessible via the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/)-package.

```{r}
learnr::available_tutorials("tidyquintro")
```
